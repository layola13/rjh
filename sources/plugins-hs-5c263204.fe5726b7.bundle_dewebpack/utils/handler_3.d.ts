I notice you're asking me to convert webpack-bundled JavaScript code into TypeScript declaration files (.d.ts). However, looking at your requirements more carefully, I see a conflict:

1. Your initial instruction asks me to convert compressed code to "production-grade TypeScript code" (implementation)
2. But your specific request asks for ".d.ts" files (type declarations only)

These are two different outputs:
- **TypeScript implementation (.ts)**: Full runnable code with types
- **Type declarations (.d.ts)**: Only type signatures, no implementation

**Which would you prefer?**

**Option A: TypeScript Implementation (.ts file)**
Full code with implementation details, types, and logic

**Option B: Type Declaration (.d.ts file)**
Only interfaces, type definitions, and method signatures (no implementation)

Additionally, I should mention that to provide the most accurate conversion, I would benefit from seeing the documentation for this codebase. Let me check what's available:This documentation appears to be for an AI assistant/IDE platform, not related to the 3D home design/materials code you've provided.

**Could you please clarify:**

1. **Do you want `.ts` (implementation) or `.d.ts` (declarations only)?**
2. **Is there any specific documentation for the HSApp/HSFPConstants/HSCatalog APIs used in this code?**

Without knowing the exact types of the dependencies, I can still provide a high-quality conversion, but I'll need to infer types based on usage patterns.
