 * This module serves as a type definition file for glTF 2.0 loader interfaces.

// This module appears to be an empty re-export module or side-effect module.
// In the original webpack bundle, it only called i.r(t) which marks the module as ES module.
// No actual interfaces or types were exported in the provided code.

// If this file should contain glTF 2.0 loader interfaces, they would typically include:

/**
 * Placeholder for glTF 2.0 loader interface definitions.
 * 
 * Common glTF 2.0 interfaces might include:
 * - IGLTFLoader: Main loader interface
 * - IGLTFLoaderExtension: Extension system interface
 * - IGLTFValidation: Validation configuration
 * 
 * Note: The actual interface definitions were not present in the provided webpack module.
