/**
 * OBJ Loading Options Module
 * 
 * This module appears to be a side-effect only module that performs module registration
 * or initialization for OBJ file loading options in a Babylon.js loader context.
 * 
 * The original module had no exports and only called module registration (i.r(t)),
 * which typically marks a module as an ES module in webpack's runtime.

// This module has no exports - it was likely used for side effects only
// such as registering types or initializing global state.
