/**
 * Style injection side-effect module for VListGroup component.
 * 
 * When imported, this module automatically injects the VListGroup component styles
 * into the document. It contains no runtime exports as it only performs the side
 * effect of registering CSS.
 * 
 * @remarks
 * This is a CSS/Sass module that has been processed by webpack's style-loader
 * or similar tooling. The actual styles are injected into the DOM at runtime.
