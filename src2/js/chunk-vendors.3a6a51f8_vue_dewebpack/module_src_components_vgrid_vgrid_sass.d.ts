/**
 * Type definition for VGrid SASS module.
 * 
 * This module represents a CSS/SASS file that has been processed by webpack.
 * In TypeScript projects with CSS modules, these files are imported for their
 * side effects (injecting styles into the DOM) and typically don't export any values.
 * 
 * @remarks
 * This is a style-only module with no runtime exports. When imported, it registers
 * the VGrid component's styles with the application's style system.
