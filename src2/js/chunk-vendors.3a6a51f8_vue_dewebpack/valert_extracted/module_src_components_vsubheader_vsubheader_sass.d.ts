/**
 * Style injection function for VSubheader component
 * 
 * This function is called during module initialization to inject the compiled
 * SASS styles into the document. It has no runtime exports and exists purely
 * for its side effects (style injection).
 * 
 * @remarks
 * This is typically handled automatically by webpack's style-loader or similar tools.
 * The module has no static exports as it only injects styles into the DOM.
