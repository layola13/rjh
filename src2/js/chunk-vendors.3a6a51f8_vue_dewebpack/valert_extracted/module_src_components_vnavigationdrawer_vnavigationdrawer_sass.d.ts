/**
 * Style module type definition for VNavigationDrawer SASS file.
 * 
 * This module doesn't export any values - it's imported solely for its side effects
 * (injecting CSS into the DOM). The empty object type reflects this behavior.
 * 
 * @remarks
 * In Webpack configurations with style-loader or similar, SASS/CSS imports are
 * processed and their styles are injected into the page at runtime. The module
 * itself typically exports an empty object or CSS class name mappings (for CSS Modules).
