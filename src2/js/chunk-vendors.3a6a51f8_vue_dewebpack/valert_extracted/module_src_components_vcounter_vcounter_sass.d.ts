/**
 * Style exports from VCounter.sass
 * 
 * This is a side-effect import module that loads styles into the application.
 * No runtime JavaScript exports are provided - the module exists solely to
 * inject CSS into the DOM during the build process.
 * 
 * @remarks
 * In production builds, these styles are typically extracted into separate
 * CSS files or injected via style-loader. The module itself has no static
 * exports and serves only as a style dependency.
