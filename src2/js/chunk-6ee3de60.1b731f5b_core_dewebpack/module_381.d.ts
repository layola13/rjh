/**
 * ES Module export marker
 * This module was originally a webpack module (ID: 381) that simply marked itself as an ES module.
 * In modern TypeScript, this is implicit and no runtime code is needed.
 */

// No type declarations needed - this was just a module initialization stub
// that set the __esModule flag for webpack's interop layer.
// In native ES modules, this is handled automatically by the runtime.
