I understand you want me to convert webpack-bundled JavaScript code into TypeScript declaration files (.d.ts). However, I need to clarify something important:

The instructions you provided ask me to convert compressed code into **production-level TypeScript code** (implementation files), but your request asks for **.d.ts files** (type declaration files). These are two different things:

1. **TypeScript implementation (.ts)** - Contains actual executable code with type annotations
2. **TypeScript declarations (.d.ts)** - Contains only type signatures/interfaces without implementation

**Which would you like me to produce?**

Based on the code analysis, this appears to be a plugin module for a window/construction design application that handles corner window manipulation with features like:
- Property bar configuration
- Material/style editing
- Window frame, sill, and pocket management
- Command pattern implementation

Please confirm:
- **Option A**: Full TypeScript implementation file (.ts) with cleaned code, types, and logic
- **Option B**: Type declaration file (.d.ts) with only interfaces and type signatures

Let me know and I'll generate the appropriate output following all the refactoring rules you specified (removing webpack wrappers, using modern ES2020+ syntax, adding proper types, meaningful names, etc.).
