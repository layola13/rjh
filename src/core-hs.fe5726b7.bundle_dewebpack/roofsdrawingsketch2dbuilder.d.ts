/**
 * Module: RoofsDrawingSketch2dBuilder
 * 
 * This module provides types and builders for creating and managing roof drawings

 * - RoofDrawingRegion: Represents a specific region within a roof drawing
 * - RoofsDrawing: The main drawing container for roof structures
 * - RoofsDrawingSketch2dBuilder: Builder class for constructing 2D roof sketches
 * 
 * @module RoofsDrawingSketch2dBuilder
