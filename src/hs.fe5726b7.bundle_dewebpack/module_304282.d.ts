/**
 * Webpack asset module that exports the URL path to an SVG arrow icon.
 * This module represents a static asset that has been processed by Webpack's asset/resource loader.
 * The SVG file is copied to the output directory with a content hash in its filename for cache busting.
 * 
 * @module ArrowAsset
 * @remarks
 * Original module ID: 304282
 * Asset filename: arrow.20130fa2.svg
 * The content hash (20130fa2) ensures that when the file content changes, the filename changes,
 * invalidating browser caches automatically.
