/**
 * Performs a bitwise XOR operation with 4 to rotate or flip a value.
 * This is commonly used in image processing to rotate an orientation by 180 degrees.
 * 
 * @param value - The input value to be transformed (typically an orientation flag or bit pattern)
 * @returns The result of XOR operation between 4 and the input value
 * 
 * @example
