I notice you've asked me to convert this to a `.d.ts` TypeScript declaration file, but the code you've provided is a complex React component implementation, not just type definitions. 

Let me clarify: would you like me to:

1. **Extract type definitions** (`.d.ts`) describing the interfaces and types used in this module, OR
2. **Refactor the implementation code** into clean, modern TypeScript (`.ts`/`.tsx`)?

Based on your initial instruction mentioning "生产级别的TypeScript代码" (production-grade TypeScript code), I believe you want **option 2** - a full refactoring of the implementation.

However, the provided code is extremely large and complex. Before I proceed, could you confirm:

- Do you want the **full implementation refactored** into modern TypeScript?
- Or do you specifically need **only the type definitions** (`.d.ts`)?

Also, this code has many external dependencies (`HSApp`, `ResourceManager`, `adskUser`, etc.) that I cannot fully type without their definitions. I'll need to make reasonable assumptions about their types.

Please confirm your preference, and I'll provide the appropriate conversion.
